The program is a simple circular linked list builder in Java. 
It creates a list where each item (node) holds a number. 
It starts by asking the user for nine numbers, creates a circular list from these inputs, and calculates the total of these numbers. 
After that, it displays both the total sum of the numbers and the entire circular list. 
Overall, it's a basic program that builds a circular list of numbers and shows the total of those numbers.
