This Java program creates a graph using numbers to represent points (vertices) and lines (edges) between them. 
Initially, it sets up a graph with vertices numbered from 1 to 5 and connects them in different ways. 
Then, it expands the graph by adding more points (vertices 6 to 10) and lines (edges) to link them together. 
Finally, the program shows all the connections (edges) in the graph by printing out the starting and ending points for each line. 
Essentially, this code helps build and display a graph with connected points and lines between them.
