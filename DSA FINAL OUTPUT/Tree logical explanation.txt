
The Java program creates a family tree-like structure using code. 
It counts and shows the total number of endpoints, called "leaf nodes," in this tree. The code uses three classes: Node, Tree, and Main.


The Node class defines each person in the tree with a unique character. It connects people as parents and children.


The Tree class manages the tree-related operations, especially counting the number of leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are individuals without children.


The Main class is where the tree gets created and filled with characters representing family members. 
Then it calculates and displays the total count of individuals with no children (leaf nodes) within the family tree structure. 
This program provides an easy way to visualize and count the ends of the family branches in a tree-like structure.
