This Java program uses a concept called a "stack," similar to a pile of books. 
It offers a menu for three actions: adding (pushing) a book onto the stack, removing (popping) the top book from the stack, 
and displaying all the books currently in the stack. Users choose an action, and the program carries out that action based on their selection. 
It repeats these options continuously, allowing users to manage and see the books in the stack as they wish.
